## Overview
The AI-enabled Blood Donation Mobile Application is made in flutter and firebase, designed to address the critical challenge of ensuring timely blood donations across the country. The platform intelligently matches patients with the most suitable blood donors using multiple criteria such as age, blood group, weight, and donation history. 

Beyond donor-matching, the application fosters direct communication by enabling users to chat with one another. Users can create multiple blood requests, while donors are limited to making a single active donation offer at a time. To enhance convenience, donors have the flexibility to switch their donor availability mode ON or OFF based on their current status.

This smart and user-friendly solution not only streamlines the process of finding compatible donors but also promotes a more reliable and efficient blood donation ecosystem.
